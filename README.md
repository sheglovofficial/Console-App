# C# "Ð¡onsole Application"
Welcome to my first GitHub repository.

I am just starting to learn the C # programming language so I wrote a simple console application

This application displays information about a person after he enters certain data.

<h1> How to run this console application: </h1>
<ol> 
  <li> Download source files </li> 
  <li> Open project files in any text editor </li>
  <li> Run the application with the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + F5 (if it is Visual Studio) </li>
</ol>
